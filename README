Welcome to EOS32-on-ECO32!

This project is a port of UNIX, 7th Edition, to the 32-bit RISC
system ECO32, which is a system-on-chip (written in synthesizable
Verilog), together with a simulator, so that one can experiment
without the need to have an FPGA board available. EOS32 is placed
onto a disk partition of a simulated disk and can be bootstrapped
from there.

NOTE 1: This is derived work from the original UNIX, 7th Edition
by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and many other people. Thus the
AUTHORS file does of course not list the original authors but the
small group of people who did work on the ECO32 and the port of
UNIX to this machine. See the LICENSE.pdf file for permission
to use the original software in this way.

NOTE 2: It is absolutely necessary to first download and build
the ECO32 project, which is available on the OpenCores platform:

        http://opencores.org/project,eco32

NOTE 3: After building ECO32 you can build EOS32-on-ECO32. In
order to utilize the various tools from the ECO32 project, you
will be asked to supply a path to the "build" directory of the
ECO32 project. The path depends on your local installation, but
usually ends in .../eco32/trunk/build.

NOTE 4: After building EOS32-on-ECO32, go back to the ECO32
tree. In .../eco32/trunk/build/run you can build a disk and
run the simulator as usual (make run-sim). The disk will be
populated with EOS32 partitions.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact the ECO32 team by email to

Enjoy!
