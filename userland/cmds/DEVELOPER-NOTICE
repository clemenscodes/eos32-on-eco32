IMPORTANT DEVELOPER NOTICE  -  PLEASE READ 
=======================================================

As the name says, the goal of the selfhosting branch is
to make EOS32 capable of compiling itself.
This plan includes various different parts of the operating 
system. By name, there are: 

- kernel
- libraries
- commands (binaries)
- games 

To have a base for the selfhosting approach, we need
to put the sources of the above mentioned system parts
into the target machine's file system. 

It is important to understand, that the source code
for the cross-compile version of a command slightly
differs from the self-hosted version.
In example, there are some build paths in Makefiles which
are pointing to the cross-compiling environment under 
Linux, but need to point to something like /bin/... under 
EOS32. 

Besides that, our goal is to provide the exact same
binaries from the cross-compiling attempt and from
the self-hosting attempt. All other behaviour will
irritate the user to the maximum.

To prevent some accidents like forgetting to change
BOTH versions of a command if you modify something,
we LINK (as in symbolic link) equal source files
under userland/usr/src to their corresponding files
under userland/cmds. 

To automate and control this, we created a tool
named 'ctrlsymlinks'. You will find it in the
project root in a subfolder called 'tools'.

Please don't mess up with this system!
